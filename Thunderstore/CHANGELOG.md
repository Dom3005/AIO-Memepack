# 1.3
- Removed my attempts at boombox syncing, as apparently song load order is not that random and the order of songs played kept the same every round. I recommend using another mod, such as [FutureSaviour's Sync Fix](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FutureSavior/Boombox_Sync_Fix/)
- Added chicken nuggets

# 1.2
- Fixed boombox out-of-sync issues, assuming all players use the same boombox songs (i recommend [AIO Boombox Songs mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Dom3005/AIO_Boombox_Songs/))
- Boomboxes can be picked up in-flight now

# 1.1
- Ship vote can be disabled
- Minor bugfixes
- Boombox songs can be skipped by pressing Q
